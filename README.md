## About CineFilm

● overview ●
  A user-only app where you can share your thoughts on movies and make friends.

● Production background ●
  One of my hobbies is watching movies.
  Now that social media is evolving, many people have experienced spoilers for 
  movies they want to see being posted on their media without any warning. I 
  am one of those who actually experienced it.
  I thought there was a need for an app that allows people to interact in real 
  time for people who want to share their impressions immediately after 
  watching a movie, or who want to make friends with the same interests as 
  they don't care about spoilers.
