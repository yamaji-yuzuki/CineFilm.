### About CineFilm

● overview ● <br />
&emsp;A user-only app where you can share your thoughts on movies and make friends.

● Production background ●<br />
&emsp;One of my hobbies is watching movies.<br />
&emsp;Now that social media is evolving, many people have experienced spoilers for movies they want to see being posted on their media without &emsp;any warning. I am one of those who actually experienced it.<br />
&emsp;I thought there was a need for an app that allows people to interact in real time for people who want to share their impressions immediately &emsp;after watching a movie, or who want to make friends with the same interests as they don't care about spoilers.
