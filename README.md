## About CineFilm

● overview ● <br />
&emsp;A user-only app where you can share your thoughts on movies and make friends.

● Production background ●<br />
&emsp;One of my hobbies is watching movies.
&emsp;Now that social media is evolving, many people have experienced spoilers for 
&emsp;movies they want to see being posted on their media without any warning. I 
&emsp;am one of those who actually experienced it.
&emsp;I thought there was a need for an app that allows people to interact in real 
&emsp;time for people who want to share their impressions immediately after 
&emsp;watching a movie, or who want to make friends with the same interests as 
&emsp;they don't care about spoilers.
